Here are some scribed notes from Hao's linear algebra lecture today, which recap a few of the interesting results he mentioned. As a standard disclaimer, this isn't a proper substitute for attending/watching lecture yourself or taking your own notes â€“ for instance, I didn't bother to write down everything, nor did I address the justifications for many ideas.
