other results from epipolar geometry
------------------------------------

1. the fundamental matrix is rank 2 because it maps a projective plane
   to a projective line (aka pencil of lines), meaning there is a loss of one dimension

2. the fundamental matrix has 7 DOF
   because of homogeneous coordinates (-1 DOF) and the fact that the rank is 2 (-1 DOF)

3. the skew-symmetric matrix Tx arises b/c of a cross product between t and another vector,
   and is simply the matrix formulation of a cross product
   
4. the epipolar line equation is given by the epipolar constraint according to grouping,
   e.g. if we have p, the epipolar line equation in image 2 is (x)^T (Fp) = 0

5. you can define R, t to be the transformation from camera 1's frame to camera 2's frame
   OR from camera 2's frame to camera 1's frame â€“ both result in the same epipolar constraint

6. the reason we have to do SVD(W) or eigendecomposition(W^TW)
   is because we're solving Wf = 0, and standard least squares would just give a solution of 0
