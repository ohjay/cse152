### Class
- This class is what you make of it. You are not forced to do anything, but you have the option to do everything.
- There is one way to learn, and one way to master. To **iterate** is to learn; to **teach** is to master.
- Don't look things up and don't ask for help until you've really thought about it for yourself. You can't just take everyone else's thoughts; they will not always be available so it's not worth it in the long run.
- have both slides (short, for presentation) and notes (comprehensive, for reading) and schedule for posting ("I am going to post these before section; please read them. It will provide an overview of the topics we're going to cover") as the best way to learn is to read beforehand, process it, and then process it again during lecture/section. One needs a two-step process, even if it's just a warmup and a description and an exercise. One needs a "beforehand"

### Life
- Keep trying and eventually you'll stumble onto something. But you have to try, have to think, have to _do_ something and give yourself that chance to stumble onto something.
- Don't worry about whether you're good enough. You probably aren't as good as the best, but who is to say what's enough? If you don't do anything you will never be that good; the only way is to do things. You just have to do things.
- Drink a ridiculous amount of water.

### Falling Asleep*
- (saw something on reddit; add)
- no nap
- eat a lot
- tire yourself out
- tire your eyes out: blink a lot
- read something boring before bed
- coffee okay on occasion, try not to get addicted until you're older

\* not to be applied during CSE 152
