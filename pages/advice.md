_My first advice: take all of my advice with a grain of salt._

          <p>Don’t look things up and don’t ask for help till you’ve really thought about the problem/idea for yourself. You can’t just take everybody else’s thoughts. (It sounds like I’m talking about cheating but I’m not; I’m talking about getting all of the insights fed to you.) Others’ thoughts will not always be available, so it’s not worth it in the long run.</p>

          <p>For CSE 152: I am going to post both slides (short, oriented toward presentation) and notes (more comprehensive, oriented toward reading). These will be posted before section, so please look over them beforehand. You will get much more out of lecture/section if you have already processed the concepts beforehand. A multi-stage process, a “beforehand,” is the cornerstone of learning, even when it’s just a warmup and a description before an exercise. Iteration is your best friend here (as in all pursuits): consciously make an effort to iterate on your understanding of these ideas!</p>

          <p>Don't wait to start your assignment (or your studying). Do it now. Like right now. You can keep reading after you break new ground.</p>

          <p>There are four main reasons, not exclusive, to pursue something. One is that you are good at it. Another is that you can be paid for it. Another is that people need it. And finally there is the possibility that you love it. This last reason is the most important, I think, and is arguably most likely to precipitate each of the others. It is much easier to excel at something if you enjoy it, for example, because then you will be happy to spend time improving at it. So enjoy – or find a way to feel like you enjoy – what you do!</p>

          <p><em>For every good photo you capture, there are a thousand terrible ones.</em> Perhaps this will be obvious, but if you keep trying different approaches then eventually you’ll stumble onto something that works. Generally, the more mindful you are about choosing approaches, the less time this process will take. But the key is to try, to think, to <em>do</em> things in order to give yourself the chance to fall into flashes of “brilliance.” The only way is to do things. You just have to do things.</p>

          <p>You've probably heard about tiring yourself out during the day (exercise! and I do advocate for this because it does work – physical exhaustion is powerful), but have you heard about tiring out your <em>eyes</em> specifically? Because once upon a time somebody presented me with this bizarre-sounding advice. You may wonder what this person meant by "tiring out your eyes." I'll tell you: he meant "blinking a lot." I can't say I have observed any positive benefit from this, but I thought it was funny and who knows? – maybe it will help you.</p>

          <p>In my experience, pre-sleep reading increases drowsiness. Just avoid anything too thrilling.</p>
