I would like to encourage interactivity. Please comment on these posts if you are confused or have anything to say!

<br /><br />

Taking this class is your third-best opportunity to know this stuff (the best opportunities are if you get to use the material, or teach the material). But right now you have the incentive of a grade, you have the advantage of doing weekly homeworks. You should be able to teach this stuff too. And there's value in it.

<br /><br />

If your slides and presentation are good, I can post it here for others to use. :)

<h3>TODO</h3>

<ul>
  <li>figure out Disqus</li>
  <li>have both slides (short, for presentation) and notes (comprehensive, for reading) and schedule for posting ("I am going to post these before section; please read them. It will provide an overview of the topics we're going to cover") as the best way to learn is to read beforehand, process it, and then process it again during lecture/section. One needs a two-step process, even if it's just a warmup and a description and an exercise. One needs a "beforehand"</li>
  <li>provide videos when possible</li>
  <li>encourage comments and interactivity for everything ("I'm no scary professor; you can talk to me. Off with the masks! â€“ I'm just another random student like you, trying to keep afloat in life")</li>
  <li>create bookable Google Calendar slots(https://it.stonybrook.edu/help/kb/creating-bookable-appointment-slots-in-google-calendar, https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/190998?hl=en)</li>
  <li>let people get email notifications for updates a la https://danieltakeshi.github.io/subscribe.html</li>
  <li>check phone (288-8553 text) for more monologue</li>
</ul>
