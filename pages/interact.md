I would like to encourage interactivity. There are several ways you can engage...

#### Commenting on posts

#### Teaching the material

Taking this class is your third-best opportunity to know this stuff [behind (1) getting to apply the material, and (2) getting to teach the material]. You have the advantage of regular lectures, you have the incentive of a grade â€“ you should be able to teach this stuff too. And there's value in that: recall that teaching is one of the two best opportunities for understanding something. ;)

So I'd like to give you the opportunity to teach.

If your slides and presentation are good, I can post it here for others to use. :)
