I would like to encourage interactivity. There are several ways you can engage...

#### Commenting on posts
Please comment on these posts if you are confused or have anything to say! If you don't want to make an account, you can post as a guest. You can say anything you like (assuming good intentions): questions about the material, an additional explanation, etc. For other tips on commenting, see [here](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/article/5).

_Why do this?_ Pedagogy research has found that formalizing your thoughts helps with learning.

#### Teaching the material

Taking this class is your third-best opportunity to know this stuff (behind getting to apply the material, and getting to teach the material). You have the advantage of regular lectures, you have the incentive of a grade â€“ you should be able to teach this stuff too. And there's value in that: recall that teaching is one of the two best opportunities for understanding something. ;)

However, many of you might not have the opportunity to teach. So I'd like to give you that opportunity. Every week, I'll create a number of bookable Google calendar slots for any of you guys to explain concepts to _me_. I would expect some level of preparation, e.g. slides or a readiness to "lecture" with the use of notes or a whiteboard.

If your slides and presentation are good, I can post it here for others' benefit as well. :)

_Tips on giving a presentation_: check out [these slides by Antonio Torralba](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/jcirbunfsor3sh/i54riyaslsX/jgvhcnsbmjkb/GiveAGoodTalk.pdf), or [these slides by Kristen Grauman](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/citizenofcvpr/static/slides/grauman_preparing_clear_talks.pdf).

#### Office hours

If there's anything else you'd like to talk about, you can visit me in office hours.
