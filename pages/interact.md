I would like to encourage interactivity. There are several ways you can engage...

#### Commenting on posts
Please comment on these posts if you are confused or have anything to say! If you don't want to make an account, you can post as a guest. You can say anything you like (assuming good intentions): questions about the material, an additional explanation, etc. For other tips on commenting, see [here](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/article/5).

_Why do this?_ Pedagogy research has found that formalizing your thoughts helps with learning.

#### Teaching the material

Teaching isn't a one-way conduit; it's valuable for the teacher as well as the student. (Maybe our teachers should be paying _us_.) In the words of the theoretical computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou, "teaching is the only way [...] to understand something." I think there's a lot of truth in that statement. If you want to get a really good grasp on something, you should try teaching it â€“ summarize the importance, the main ideas, the math, etc. This should make the concept much clearer in your head, and you may even encounter cracks in your understanding that you can fix.

But many of you might not have the opportunity to teach. So that you have no excuse, I'd like to make sure that's not the case. ;) In other words, you're free to explain concepts to _me_, a questioning and responsive student. I'm serious; I'll create a number of 30-minute Google calendar slots that you can book each week, to teach the material to someone who cares about it (me). **Note: I would expect some level of preparation, e.g. a plan of attack that includes slides or a readiness to illustrate the material on paper/whiteboard.** You can go over any topic (or tangential topic) we've covered in the class so far.

Of course, there would be no tangible incentive to this (i.e. it's unofficial and not explicitly part of any grade), but I'd hope that it would still impact your learning in a positive way. On the plus side, it's low-pressure and purely for your benefit!

You can book a teaching slot via the Google calendar linked below.

</div>

By the way, if your slides and presentation are good (and you're okay with it), I can post it here for others' benefit as well. :)

#### Office hours

If there's anything else you'd like to talk about, you can visit me in office hours.
