\question What does it mean for a filter to be shift-invariant?

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
If a filter is shift-invariant, it will perform the same high-level computation (e.g. taking a median of a neighborhood) no matter which part of the signal it is being applied to. The filter will do the same thing no matter where we put it.

Mathematically, this means $[I(x, y) * f](x - n, y - k) = [I(x - n, y - k) * f](x, y)$.

\question One application of filtering/convolution is template matching: finding regions in an image that are similar to a given patch. How would you imagine that this is done?

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
Convolve the image with the (flipped) patch. In the resulting image, a high brightness at a pixel means that the patch is very similar to the neighborhood around that pixel.

\question How do you obtain an edge image if you're only allowed a blurring filter?

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
Apply the blurring filter, then subtract the result from the original image. (The blurred image represents low frequencies. After subtracting these out, we are left with the high frequencies.)
