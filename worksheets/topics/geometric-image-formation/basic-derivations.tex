Let $\mathbf{P} = (X, Y, Z)$ be a point in the camera frame shown above, and let $\mathbf{P'} = (x, y)$ be its perspective projection in the real image plane. Using similar triangles, derive the associated perspective projection equation(s), i.e. the equation(s) for $\mathbf{P'}$ in terms of $\mathbf{P}$.

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
$$x = -\frac{fX}{Z},~y = -\frac{fY}{Z}$$
\end{solution}

\question If the $Z$-axis were pointing in the opposite direction, what would the perspective projection equations become? (Assume that the $X$- and $Y$-axes remain unchanged.)

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
$$x = \frac{fX}{Z},~y = \frac{fY}{Z}$$
\end{solution}

\question If we place a virtual image plane in front of the camera (i.e. in the world) at a distance $f'$ along the $Z$-axis, what are the projection equations for a point $\mathbf{Q'} = (x_v, y_v)$ on that virtual plane? Use the original coordinate system (the one depicted in the diagram).

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
$$x_v = \frac{fX}{Z},~y_v = \frac{fY}{Z}$$
\end{solution}
